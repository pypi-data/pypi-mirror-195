## About The Project ##

This Python CLI tool helps you bootstrap WSO2 ESB MFT (Managed File Transfer) projects easily. With this tool, you can create projects either by using the CLI interface or by passing a configuration file to the application.

Using the CLI interface, you can create WSO2 ESB MFT projects interactively by following the prompts. Alternatively, you can create a configuration file that defines your project's details, and then pass this file to the CLI tool to create the project automatically.

This project was developed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind, with the aim of making it easier for developers to create and manage WSO2 ESB MFT projects.
