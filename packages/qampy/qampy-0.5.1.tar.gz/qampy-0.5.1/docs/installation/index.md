# Installation

QAMpy is developed on Python 3. As Python 2 is now end of life we will only support Python 3.

QAMPy depends on the following python modules:

* numpy 
* scipy 
* pythran 

You will also need to have a  working c/c++ compiler with open-mp support installed to compile 
the pythran modules, on linux both gcc or clang work, for windows see the instructions below.


We provide installation instructions for Linux and Windows. OSX installation is not tested but should closely resemble the Linux instructions.
