def comp_rf_delay(signal, delay):

    Adds a delay to the signal in frequency domain. Can be
    used to compensate for impairments such as RF cables of different length
    between the optical hybrid and ADC.

    Parameters
    ----------
        signal : signalobject
            Real-valued input signal
        delay : float
            Delay  in s
