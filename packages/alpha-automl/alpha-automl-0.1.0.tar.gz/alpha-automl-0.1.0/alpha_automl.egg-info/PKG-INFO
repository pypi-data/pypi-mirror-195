AlphaAutoML is an AutoML system that automatically searches for models and derives end-to-end pipelines that read, 
pre-process the data, and train the model. AlphaAutoML leverages recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and is 
able to adapt to different application domains and problems through incremental learning.

AlphaAutoML provides data scientists and data engineers the flexibility to address complex problems by leveraging the 
Python ecosystem, including open-source libraries and tools, support for collaboration, and infrastructure that enables 
transparency and reproducibility. 

This repository is part of New York University's implementation of the 
[Data Driven Discovery project (D3M)](https://datadrivendiscovery.org/).
