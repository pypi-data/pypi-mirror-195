`litstudy` is a Python package that allows analysis of scientific literature from the comfort of a Jupyter notebook.
It enables selecting scientific publications and study their metadata using visualizations, network analysis, and natural language processing.

In essence, this package offers five features

* Extract metadata of scientific documents from various sources. The data is united by a standard interface, allowing data from different sources to be combined.
* Filter, select, deduplicate, and annotate collections of documents.
* Compute and plot general statistics of document sets (e.g., statistics on authors, venues, publication years, etc.)
* Generate and plot various bibliographic networks as an interactive visualization.
* Topic discovery based on natural language processing (NLP) allows automatic discovery of popular topics.

```


## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://nlesc.github.io/litstudy/).


## Requirements
The package has been tested for Python 3.7. Required packages are available in `requirements.txt`.

`litstudy` supports several data sources.
Some of these sources (such as semantic Scholar, CrossRef, and arXiv) are openly available.
However to access the Scopus API, you (or your institute) requires a Scopus subscription and you need to request an Elsevier Developer API key (see [Elsevier Developers](https://dev.elsevier.com/index.jsp)).
