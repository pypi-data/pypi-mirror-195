I'm a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.
Currently I'm doing research in piano performance nuance:
for example, how to mathematically model the changes in
timing and dynamics at the ends of phrases.
This requires data (e.g. MIDI files) describing expert performances.
Such data is scarce and hard to obtain.

The data collected by Yamaha for Disklaviers would be ideal for this purpose,
both because of its scope and because it has better resolution than MIDI.
Would it be possible for me to access some or all of this data?
I'd keep it on a secure computer and would use it only for my research,
and I'd be happy to sign a contract to this effect.
The result of this work would be papers in academic journals
(such as the MIT Computer Music Journal)
in which I'd acknowledge Yamaha.
