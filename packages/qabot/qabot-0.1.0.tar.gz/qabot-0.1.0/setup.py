[y/n] (y): y\n\n ðŸš€ Query: what was the largest family who did not survive? \nQuery: what was the largest family who did not survive?\nResult:\nThe largest family who did not survive was the Sage family, with 8 members.\n\n ðŸš€ any further questions? [y/n] (y): n\n\n```\n\n## Connect to a live database:\n\nInstall any required drivers for your database, e.g. `pip install psycopg2-binary` for postgres.\n\nFor example to connect and query directly from the trains database in the [relational dataset repository](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/Trains):\n\n```bash\n$ pip install mysqlclient\n\n$ qabot -d mysql+mysqldb://guest:relational@relational.fit.cvut.cz:3306/trains -q "what are the unique load shapes of cars, what are the maximum number of cars per train?" \nQuery: what are the unique load shapes of cars, what are the maximum number of cars per train?\nResult:\nThe unique load shapes of cars are circle, diamond, hexagon, rectangle, and triangle, and the maximum number of cars per train is 3.\n\n```\n\n### Links\n- [Python library docs](https://langchain.readthedocs.io)\n- [Agent docs to talk to arbitrary apis via OpenAPI/Swagger](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/agents/agent_toolkits/openapi.html)\n- [Agents/Tools to talk SQL](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/agents/agent_toolkits/sql_database.html)\n- [Typescript library](https://hwchase17.github.io/langchainjs/docs/overview/)\n\n',
