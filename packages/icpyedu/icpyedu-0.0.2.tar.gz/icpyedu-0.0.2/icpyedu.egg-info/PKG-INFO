# ICPyEdu
**ICPyEdu** is a tool for Digital Signatures using ICPEdu Certificate. This _package_ was developed as a complementary artifact to the completion of the course work of the student **Kemuel dos Santos Rocha** to obtain the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

**ICPyEdu** is a library for educational purposes and allows signing documents in _.pdf_ format, as well as verifying the digital signature.

## How to install the library

To install the library, just run the command below:
```python
pip install icpyedu
```
## How to import library classes and methods

To use the features of the _package_, import with the following code:
```python
from icpyedu import signer
```

To instantiate the class responsible for the digital signature methods, just declare a variable receiving _Sign_ as follows:
```python
var = signer.Sign()
```

To instantiate the class responsible for the digital signature verification methods, just declare a variable receiving _Verifier_ as follows:
```python
var = signer.Verify()
```

Finally, to use it to sign a pdf, just call the _signFile_ function passing the requested parameters, for example:
```python
var.signFile("email", "password", "filePath", "certificatePath")
```

Similarly, to verify a pdf, just call the _verifySignature_ function passing the requested parameters, for example:
```python
var.verifySignature("pdf","certifying authority_1", "certifying authority_2")
```
Certificate authority certificates are files that come with the personal certificate exported by ICPEdu
