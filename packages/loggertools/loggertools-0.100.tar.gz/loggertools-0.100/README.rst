About loggertools
-----------------

``loggertools`` is a Python port of the Control File Functions of the Logger
Tools Software of Olaf Kolle, MPI-BGC Jena, (c) 2012.

From the Logger Tools Software manual:
"The functions range from simple mathematic operations to more complex
and special procedures including functions for checking data. Most of
the functions have the following appearance: `y = f(x, p1, p2, ..., pn)`
where `y` is the variable in which the result of the function `f` is
stored, `x` is the input variable of the function and `p1` to `pn` are
parameters (numbers) of the function. An output variable (result of a
function) may be the same as an input variable. Some functions need
more than one input variable, some functions do not need any parameter
and some functions (`mean`, `mini`, `maxi`) may have a variable number
of input variables."

The complete documentation of ``loggertools`` is available at:

   https://mcuntz.github.io/loggertools/

and the API can be found here:

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is via `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install loggertools

or via `conda`:

.. code-block:: bash

Logger Tool Functions
---------------------

Some functions are renamed compared to the original logger tools:

   `chs` -> `varchs`

   `add` -> `varadd`

   `sub` -> `varsub`

   `mul` -> `varmul`

   `div` -> `vardiv`

   `sqr` -> `varsqr` / `varsqrt`

   `exp` -> `varexp`

   `log` -> `varlog`

   `pot` -> `varpot`

Not all functions are implemented (yet). Missing functions are:

   `varset`

   `met_torad`

   `met_psy_rh`

   `met_dpt_rh`

   `write`

Some functions are slightly enhanced, which is reflected in the
documentation of the indidual functions.

All functions have an additional keyword `undef`, which defaults to -9999.:
elements are excluded from the calculations if any of the inputs equals `undef`.

Only bit_test and the if-statements `ifeq`, `ifne`, `ifle`, `ifge`, `iflt`, `igt`
do not have the `undef` keyword.

The Logger Tools control functions implemented are:

    1. Assignment
