        **DESCRIPTION**
        
        
        ``OPR`` is a runtime (program) that is intended to be programmable, with a
        client program to develop modules on and a daemonised version that can run
        in the background. ``OPR`` provides object persistence, an event handler and
        some basic code to load modules that can provide additional functionality.
        
        
        ``OPR`` uses object programming (opv), the object oriented programming without
        the oriented ;] Object programming is that method are seperated out into
        functions that use the object as the first argument of that funcion. This gives
        base class definitions a clean namespace to inherit from and to load json data
        into the object's __dict__. A clean namespace prevents a json loaded attribute
        to overwrite any methods.
        
        
        **INSTALL**
