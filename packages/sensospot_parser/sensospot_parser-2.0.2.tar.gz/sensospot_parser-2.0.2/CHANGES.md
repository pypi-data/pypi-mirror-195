 - added type hints


0.6.0 - doing splits
--------------------

 - the modules `utils` and `dynamic_range` were deleted and will be moved into a separate project
 - the resulting output file format is now a tab-delimered csv for more compability


0.5.0 - real life fixes
-----------------------

 - parsing parameters now sets the exposure time as float
 - parsing metadata fails silently
 - big rework on column names
 - only most necessary functions exposed on import of package
 - renamed cli command to `parse_sensospot_data`
