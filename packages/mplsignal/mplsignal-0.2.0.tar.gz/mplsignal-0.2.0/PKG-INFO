# mplsignal

Matplotlib extension for signal processing

Documentation can be found [here](https://mplsignal.readthedocs.io/).

mplsignal currently consists of four main parts:

   * `plane_plots`: various `splane` and `zplane` for plotting pole-zero diagrams
   * `freq_plots`: various `freqs` and `freqz` methods for plotting magnitude and phase responses of transfer functions
   * `ticker`: tickers and formatters suitable for `freqs`/`freqz`-plots
   * `scipyplot`: convenience functions that can be directly fed to `scipy.signal.freqs` and ` scipy.signal.freqz`

## Dependencies
mplsignal is only useful if you also have [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) installed.
In addition, it relies on [adjustText](https://adjusttext.readthedocs.io/) to position the multiplicity
numbers next to poles and zeros.

If [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) is installed, mplsignal will use some functions to compute frequency responses etc,
but mplsignal also has its own functions for this.

## Installation

You can install using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mplsignal
```

## Development Installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Related work

In the meantime between starting working on mplsignal and finally getting around to make it public,
[zplane](https://pypi.org/project/zplane/) was released. This can do most things that mplsignal can do and a few more.
However, the configurability is larger for mplsignal and the tickers and locators are unique features.
