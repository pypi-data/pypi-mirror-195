Versions follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``).

Right now Socon is at it's premise. For that reason, there might be backward
incompatibility between two minors. If that is the case we will
still notice in the **Deprecations** section of the releases.

Later on, backward incompatibility (breaking) changes will only be
introduced in major versions with advance notice in the **Deprecations**
section of releases.

.. note::

    You can retrieve all deprecations :doc:`here </internals/deprecations>`
