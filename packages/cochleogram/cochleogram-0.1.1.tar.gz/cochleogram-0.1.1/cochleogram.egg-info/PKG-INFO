# Cochleogram

This facilitates creating cochleograms from confocal images and will export
a frequency map and inner/outer hair cell positions along the tonotopic
axis. Where position information is stored in the file, this program can auto-tile confocal
z-stacks that were not acquired using the tile feature of the program. This
is often the case when imaging large pieces of the cochlea where setting up
the tiling and capturing it may take much longer than trying to image each
section separately.
