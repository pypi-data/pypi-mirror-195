# Pyarmor

Pyarmor is a command line tool used to obfuscate python scripts, bind
obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscated scripts.

## Key features

* The obfuscated scritpt is still a normal `.py` script, in most of
  cases the original python scripts can be replaced with obfuscated
  scripts seamlessly.
* Provide many ways to obfuscate the scripts to balance security and
  performance
* Rename functions/methods/classes/variables/arguments, irreversible
  obfuscation
* Convert part of Python functions to C functions, compile them to machine
  instructions by high optimize option, irreversible obfuscation
* Bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscted scripts
* Protect obfuscated scripts by Themida (Only for Windows)

## Support platforms

* Python 2 and Python 3[^1]
* Windows
* Many linuxs, include embedded systems, Raspberry Pi etc.
* Apple Intel and Apple Silicon
* Support arches: x86_64, aarch64, armv7 etc.[^2]

[^1]: some features may only for Python3
[^2]: some features may only for special arch.

## Quick start

Install

    pip install pyarmor

Obfuscate the script `foo.py`

    pyarmor gen foo.py

This command generates an obfuscated script `dist/foo.py` like this:

```python
    from pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__
    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x28\x83\x20\x58....')
```

Run it

    python dist/foo.py

## Change logs

It's important to read this carefully before upgrading pyarmor.

Each major version has one file to log changes, it describes the fixed
issues, new features, incompatible issues in different versions

* [Pyarmor 8.x Change Logs](docs/ChangeLogs.8)

There are significant changes in Pyarmor 8.0, users prior to 8.0 should read
this [Import Notes][import-notes] to make judge whether upgrade Pyarmor

## Import Notes for Pyarmor prior to 8.0

Pyarmor 8.0 has rewritten its core libraries, and provides 3 new commands to
generate new mode scripts.

All the new features are implemented by new commands: `gen`, `reg`, `cfg`.

In future only bug fix for old modes, no new features for old modes.

Most of the old commands could be used normally, but there still have some
changes.

There are 3 cases for old users after Pyarmor 8.0 is released:

1. Never upgrade to 8.0+
2. Upgrade to 8.0 but only use old features
3. Upgrade to 8.0 and use new features

The notes for each case

* Never upgrade to 8.0+

  - SPP mode doesn't work

    In order to use SPP mode, it's necessary to upgrade Pyarmor to 8.0+

  - Command `pyarmor register` without any argument return `404` error

    It is used to query registration information, but now license server doesn't
    serve this web api.

    Instead use `pyarmor -v` to make sure it's not trial version.

  - Registering Pyarmor by `pyarmor register pyarmor-regcode-xxxxxx.txt` can be
    used no more than 10 times

    If using Pyarmor in CI server or docker, regsiter Pyarmor by the second
    method described in the registration file "pyarmor-regcode-xxxxxx.txt"

* Upgrade to 8.0 but only use old features

  - Command `pyarmor -v` only checks and prints new Pyarmor License
  - Command `pyarmor -h` only prints help for new cli

  There are 2 solutions to make command `pyarmor` same as before:

  - Export environment variable `PYARMOR_CLI=7`
  - Recreate command `pyarmor` link to `python -m pyarmor.pyarmor`

* Upgrade to 8.0 and use new features

  - Follow new [EULA of Pyarmor](LICENSE). Especially for old personal license
    and it's used in many products, new license only allows one proudct.

  - Not all old licenses could be upgraded to new license freely, refer to
    [Pyarmor licenses][licenses]
