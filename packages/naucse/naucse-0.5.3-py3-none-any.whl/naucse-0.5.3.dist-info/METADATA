# naucse

This is a server for open course material.

To use it, you will need some content.
Usually, the repository with the content will require the `naucse` module,
and will run using `python -m naucse`.

We use content at https://github.com/pyvec/naucse.python.cz to generate
[naucse.python.cz](https://naucse.python.cz).


## Installation

Install from a virtual environment.

To install the latest release:

    (venv)$ python -m pip install naucse

To install from a cloned repository, for development:

    (venv)$ python -m pip install -e.[dev]


## Running

To run the serve, either change (`cd`) to the directory with content,
or set `NAUCSE_ROOT_PATH` to that directory.
Then run:

    (venv)$ python -m naucse serve

Instead of `serve`, you can run `freeze` to generate a static website.
See [Elsa](https://pypi.org/project/elsa/) for other usage, including
deployment to GitHub Pages.


## Served courses

The courses on the served website are taken from two sources:

- `courses.yml` in `$NAUCSE_ROOT_PATH`, with entries like:

  ```yaml
    course_slug:
        url: https://github.com/user/repo
        branch: main
        path: _compiled
  ```

  The named repositories will be cloned. At the given path in the given branch,
  naucse expects compiled course info, as prepared by
  `python -m naucse_render compile`.

  This is intended for the production site, which aggregates lots of individual
  courses.

  If `courses.yml` is present, naucse will use a pretty homepage
  (rather than listing all courses on the homepage).

- Any courses found by `python -m naucse_render ls`.
  This is useful when developing a course locally.


## Tests

Tests can be run using `tox`:

    (venv)$ tox

or `pytest` directly:

    (venv)$ python -m pytest
