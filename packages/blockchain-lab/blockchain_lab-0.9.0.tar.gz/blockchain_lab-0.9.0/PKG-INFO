        A fully functional blockchain lab.
        
        # Install
        
        ```
        pip3 install blockchain_lab
        ```
        
        # Using
        
        ## In another script
        
        You can give these parameters in blockchain_lab()
        
        - Node number with "node_number"
        - Security circle number with "security_circle_number"
        - Path with "path"
        
        ### Docker | Create & Delete
        
        ```python
        from blockchain_lab import blockchain_lab
        
        blockchain_lab().create_docker()
        ```
        
        ```python
        from blockchain_lab import blockchain_lab
        
        blockchain_lab().delete_docker()
        ```
        
        ### Local | Create & Delete
        
        ```python
        from blockchain_lab import blockchain_lab
        
        blockchain_lab().create_local()
        ```
        
        ```python
        from blockchain_lab import blockchain_lab
        
        blockchain_lab().delete_local()
        ```
        
        ### Status
        
        ```python
        from blockchain_lab import blockchain_lab
        
        blockchain_lab.status()
        ```
        
        ### Test with a transaction
        
        ```python
        from blockchain_lab import blockchain_lab
        
        blockchain_lab.send_transaction(receiver = "naruno", amount = 5000, data = "blockchain-lab")
        ```
        
        ## In command line
        
        You can give these parameters in command line arguments of
        create and delete functions.
        
        - Node number with "-nn" or "--nodenumber"
        - Security circle number with "-scn" or "--securitycirclenumber"
        - Path with "-p" or "--path"
        
        ### Docker | Create & Delete
        
        ```console
        blockchain_lab_create_docker
        ```
        
        ```console
        blockchain_lab_delete_docker
        ```
        
        ### Local | Create & Delete
        
        ```console
        blockchain_lab_create_local

        ```
        
        ### Status
        
        ```console
        blockchain_lab_status
        ```
        
        ### Test with a transaction
        
        ```console
