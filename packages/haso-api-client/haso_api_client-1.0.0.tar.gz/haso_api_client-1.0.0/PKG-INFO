Description: # Haso API Client
        
        Haso API Client is a Python package for making HTTP requests to web APIs. It provides a simple interface for sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, handling query parameters and request bodies, and parsing JSON responses. API Client is designed to be easy to use and to integrate with any Python project.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Haso API Client can be installed using pip:
        ```
        pip install haso-api-client
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here's an example of how to use Haso API Client to make a GET request:
        
        ```python
        import haso_api_client
        
        base_url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
        
        client=haso_api_client.APIClient(base_url=base_url)
        
        response, status_code, headers = client.get("/posts/1")
        
        
        ```
        API Client also supports POST, PUT, and DELETE requests:
        ```python
        
        # POST request
        data = {"userId": 1, "id": 101, "title": "test title", "body": "test body"}
        response, status_code, headers = client.post(path="/posts", data=data)
        
        # PUT request
        data = {"userId": 1, "id": 1, "title": "test title", "body": "test body"}
        response, status_code, headers = client.put(path="/posts/1", data=data)
        
        # DELETE request
        response, status_code, _ = client.delete("/posts/1")
        ```
