Docker Quick Start
-----------
This project creates a shared database.
If using docker it will create a shared network and volume that the other projects can connect to.

Start bitsoframework by running `docker-compose -f local.yml up --build`

If you are missing the network or volume you will see the following prompts:
  - create network with `docker network create bitso_local_network`
  - create volume with `docker volume create --name=bitso_local_db_volume`
