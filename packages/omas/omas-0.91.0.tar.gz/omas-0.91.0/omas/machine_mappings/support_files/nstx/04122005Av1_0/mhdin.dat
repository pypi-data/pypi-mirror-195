! Default input file for EFUND - NSTX equilibria
!
! S. Sabbagh   - First setup using Kugel's full machine specs, new vessel
!                included. A few changes made from Franco's file.
!                - Taken from specs OCT-98-Av1.1
!                  - 57 Flux loops
!                  - 104 pickup coils
!                  - 40 total vessel/plate segments
!                  - A new specification is required for this generation
!                    of EFUND. The variable is called "vsid(*)", and it
!                    allows one to remap the vessel segments. This
!                    variable was not available in the original DIII-D
!                    code
!                - "noplate" has the passive plates and outer divertor
!                   plates excluded.
!                - "full" has the vessel, outer divertor, and passive
!                   plates.
!
! S. Sabbagh   - Second setup using Kugel's full machine specs, new vessel
!                Version Nov-98-Av1.0np (passive stabilizer plates left out)
!                Changes made to vessel specs by J. Menard
!                - vessel now has 28 segments
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 02/15/99: Day 0 plasma without plates ("np" suffix)
!                adjusted as per J. Menard 2/11/99.
!                - flux loop positions changed - some significantly
!                - PF1B (not used now) is 32 turns
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 02/22/99: Day 0 plasma without plates ("np" suffix)
!                with number of vessel segments reduced to 24 from 28.
!                Need to do this since we only have ~28 measurements to fit
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 02/26/99: Day 0 plasma without plates ("np" suffix)
!                with number of vessel segments reduced to 20 from 24.
!                Need to do this to attempt to eliminate "noise" in the
!                vessel current fitting due to the reduced diagnostic set
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 06/03/99: Day 0 plasma without plates ("np" suffix)
!                with 20 vessel segments, now being modeled as F-coils
!                for greater control over the fitting of the vessel
!                segments.
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 09/17/99: Day 1 plasma with divertor and passive plates
!                Vessel discretized to 44 segments, grouped into 20
!                independent current groups - modeled as F-coils in EFIT
!                Passive plates and divertor plate/ring assemblies
!                considered as one current path each.
!                Tally:
!                GROUPS:    11 PF + 20 VV + 2 DP + 4 PP = 37 SC
!                SUBGROUPS: 19 PF + 44 VV + 10 DP + 4 PP = 77 SC
!                1 OH
!                66 FL
!                36 MC
!                Maximum R increased to 2.15 from 2.0 to fully include
!                flux around PF5 coils in plots.
!                Old vessel segment description (switched out) remains at
!                 the end of this file.
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 09/28/99: Day 1 plasma with divertor and passive plates
!                Vessel discretized to 44 segments, grouped into 20
!                independent current groups - modeled as F-coils in EFIT
!                Passive plates and divertor plate/ring assemblies
!                considered as one current path each.
!                (Same as previous)
!
!                Change here is that flux loop and Mirnov coil positions
!                have changed, and 8 Mirnov coils included before are not
!                physically in the machine (used to be in the divertor
!                region)
!
!                In addition, subdivide the stabilizing plates into two
!                segments each
!
!                Therefore, need to change all diagnostic info, and
!                stabilizing plate info
!
!                Tally:
!                GROUPS:    11 PF + 20 VV + 2 DP + 8 PP = 41 SC
!                SUBGROUPS: 19 PF + 44 VV + 10 DP + 8 PP = 81 SC

!                66 FL
!                28 MC
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 10/04/99: Day 1 plasma with divertor and passive plates
!                - tweaks to FLOBD loops (as per J. Menard), and
!                  correction to number of turns in vessel and plate
!                  specs with multiple subelements
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 11/03/99: Day 1 plasma with divertor and passive plates
!                - tweaks to FLOBD loops, Mirnov coil positions, and
!                  ex-vessel loops (as per J. Menard)
!                - NOTE: SMP2 set to 0.02 (m) (finite) to avoid
!                        EFUND logic which flips coil by 90 degrees if
!                        set = 0.0 (!).
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 11/05/99: Rebuild with SMP2(i) = 0.04 (m)
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 02/11/00: Rebuild with gap Mirnov coil positions and
!                  angles adjusted as per J. Menard / D. Loesser
!              - update Mirnov coil lengths:
!                CS Mirnovs  - 3.0 cm
!                Gap Mirnovs - 2.5 cm
!                but, presently, do not have the table build
!                sample the field along the length (test that later)
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 02/22/00: Rebuild with divertor support rails now part
!                of the vacuum vessel, rather than part of the divertor
!                plates
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 02/07/02: Rebuild with Cy2002 magnetics refit. Magnetics
!                position tweaks from Jon Menard. PF5 coil position tweak
!                made since PF5 coil was recentered during the last opening.
!
! S. Sabbagh   - Alterations for Lahey-Fujitsu Fortran 95:
!                *) NAMELIST data starts with "&" character and ends
!                   with "/" character
!                *) For some unknown reason, the grid variable line:
!                    RLEFT=0.01  RRIGHT=2.15  ZBOTTO=-2.2  ZTOP=2.2
!                   had to be broken up otherwise an error occurred.
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 04/02/04: Rebuild with Cy2004 magnetics upgrades. Magnetics
!                positions now identical to specs from Jon Menard except for
!                very minor changes to some coil shapes and plate specs.
!                ADDED:
!                42 Mirnov coils (18 plate gap, 24 divertor (tangential + normal))
!                Flux loops were reduced by 5 - KEEP these extra 5 slots as placeholders
!                6 new shaping coils
!                6 new (net) vessel segments, 5 new vessel segment groups
!                NEW TOTALS
!                GROUPS:    17 PF + 25 VV + 2 DP + 8 PP = 52 SC
!                SUBGROUPS: 25 PF + 56 VV + 4 DP + 8 PP = 93 SC
!                1 OH
!                66 FL
!                70 MC
!                Coil lengths:
!                CS Mirnovs  - 3.0 cm
!                Gap Mirnovs - 2.5 cm
!                Divertor Mirnovs (tangential) - 3.0 cm
!                Divertor Mirnovs (normal)     - 0.3 cm
!
! S. Sabbagh   - 04/12/05: NSTX 2005 specifications (build in Red Hat
!                          Enterprise Linux 3 environment). Same number of
!                          components as 04/02/04, just some different specs:
!
!                   The NSTX EFIT Green table was rebuilt for the 2005 run of
!                 NSTX to account for modifications of the PF1a coil. Changes
!                 were made to the following systems:
!
!                 1) PF1a coil rebuilt (now smaller) - completely new specs
!                 2) PF1b coil geometry slightly changed
!                 3) PFAB2 R_center slightly changed
!                 4) CS and PF1a flux loops were replaced; PF1a loops changed
!                    position
!                 5) Although not part of the Green table, the RF antenna
!                    position was measured and has changed a small bit, so the
!                    limiter file was  changed.
