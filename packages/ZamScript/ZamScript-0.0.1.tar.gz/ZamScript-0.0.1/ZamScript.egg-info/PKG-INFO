        # Basic ZamScript syntax
        `write` is a function for displaying text in the console.
        
        `{` and `}` are default brackets for functions and stuff like that.
        
        `getall [module]` is for importing all functions in a module.
        
        `get [module]` is for importing the module.
        
        `define [function_name]{inputs}` are for defining functions.
        
        Since this languages syntax format and modules are all Python based, `!pip install [package]` installs the package with `pip`.
        
        `if [statement] then` is for making an if-then statement.
        
        `is = to` and `is not = to` are for making statements about if two things are equal or not.
        
        `otherwise if` and `otherwise then` are for else and else if (elif) statements.
        
        `//` are for comments.
        
        `forever` is a infinitly repeating loop.
        
        `type` is for making classes.
        
        `sh [command]` is for running shell commands.
        
        `mod` is for taking mods between numbers.
        
        `<<<` and `>>>` are brackets for making dictionaries.
        
        `repeat [number_of_times_to_repeat]` is for repeating that code that many times (without the square brackets).
        
        `var variable_name: type` is used for predefining variables to make it run faster (not required).
        
        That rest is like Python except for the fact that it supports Cython syntax.
