class Deleveraging:
    """
  Deleveraging refers to the process of reducing a company's debt-to-equity ratio by paying down debt or increasing equity. The following are some of the key features of deleveraging:

High debt levels: Companies that are looking to deleverage typically have high levels of debt relative to their equity.
Financial distress: High levels of debt can lead to financial distress, making it difficult for companies to access capital markets or obtain new loans.
Cost of debt: Companies with high levels of debt often face high interest payments, which can reduce profitability and cash flow.
Need for financial flexibility: Companies may seek to deleverage in order to improve their financial flexibility and reduce their dependence on debt financing.
