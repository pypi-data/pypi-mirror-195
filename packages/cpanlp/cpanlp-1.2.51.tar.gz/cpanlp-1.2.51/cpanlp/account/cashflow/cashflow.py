#The most important attribute of cash flow is its ability to provide a business with the liquidity it needs to meet its financial obligations and invest in growth opportunities. This includes the ability to pay bills, make payments on debt, and fund capital expenditures. Other important attributes of cash flow include its predictability, stability, and growth potential. Additionally, factors such as the source of cash flow, such as whether it comes from operations or financing activities, as well as the timing of cash flow, are also important to consider when evaluating cash flow.
