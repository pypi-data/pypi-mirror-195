# In accounting, the most important attribute of a contract is its ability to be accurately recorded and reported. This is important because contracts often have a significant impact on a company's financial performance and the accurate recording of contract terms and obligations is essential for the preparation of financial statements. Other important attributes of contracts include their completeness, validity, and enforceability. Additionally, factors such as the ability to recognize revenue or liabilities at the appropriate time, in compliance with accounting standards, and the ability to track and report contract terms and performance are also important to consider when evaluating contracts in accounting.
