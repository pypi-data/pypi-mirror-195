# [pyStoNED2]

pyStoNED2 is a Python package that provides functions for estimating multivariate convex regression, convex quantile regression, convex expectile regression, isotonic regression, stochastic nonparametric envelopment of data, and related methods. It also facilitates efficiency measurement using the conventional data envelopement analysis (DEA) and free disposable hull (FDH) approaches. The pyStoNED2 package allows practitioners to estimate these models in an open access environment under a GPL-3.0 License.
