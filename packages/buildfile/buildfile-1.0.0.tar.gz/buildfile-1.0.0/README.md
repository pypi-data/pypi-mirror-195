Buildfile runs annoying tasks automatically.

# Docs

## Installation

Run `python -m pip install buildfile` in your terminal.

## Usage

You can use buildfile as a command, or as a module.

Example for using as a command:
```
> python -m buildfile build
Hello
```
You can specify buildfile filename with the following: `python -m buildfile tablename filename`

This will run the `build` table of the build file, note that the build file must be in the directory you're running the script from, example build file:

```
(build)
echo Hello
```

`python -m buildfile build` is the equivalent of this:

```py
import buildfile

buildfile.run("build") # You can also specify buildfile filename using
                       # buildfile.run("table_name", filename="buildfile_name")
```
