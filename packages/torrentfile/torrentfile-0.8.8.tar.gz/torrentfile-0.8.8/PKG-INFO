           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

## Usage Examples

### Creating Bittorrent Files

Basic torrent file creation is as easy and using the `create` sub-commnand and providing  
the path to the contents.

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content
```

You can add one or more trackers by using any one of `-t`, `--tracker`, `-a`, `--announce` 
flags and listing their URL as a space separated list.

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content -a http://tracker1.com http://tracker2.net
```

If you intend to distribute the file on a private tracker then you should use one  
of `-p`, `--private` flags, which tells your Bittorrent clients to disable DHT and  
multitracker protocols.

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content --private
```

By default **`torrentfile`** displays a progress bar indicating how much of the content  
has already been processed.  To turn off this display you can either use `--quiet` mode in  
as a global flag or you can set the `--prog` flag to 0.

```bash
torrentfile --quiet create /path/to/content
```

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content --prog 0
```

**`torrentfile`** extracts the name of the contents top level file or directory  
and saves the torrent file to the current working directory with the extracted title.

For example running the follwing command would create `./content.torrent`.

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content
```

To specify an alternative path or filename you may use the `-o`, `--out` flags  
followed by the relative or absolute path to your preferred output location.

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content -o /some/other/path/torrent.torrent
```

If the path `--out` path specified is an existing directory, then the torrent file will be
saved to that directory, with same filename as the default top level path name.

For example the following command would create a torrent file at `/some/other/path/content.torrent`.

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content -o /some/other/path/
```

Bittorrent protocol V1 is still the most common version in use for torrent files, 
therefore by default __`torrentfile`__ uses the version 1 format when creating the file.  
However __`torrentfile`__ has full support for creating V2 format torrent files as well as 
hybrid V1 & V2 format files. Use the `--meta-version` flag to specify which file format
should be used during torrent file creation. Options include `1`(v1 default), `2`(v2), or `3`(v1 & v2).

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content --meta-version 2
```

```bash
torrentfile create /path/to/content --meta-version 3 
```

__NEW FEATURE in v0.8.8__:

>`torrentfile` now includes the option to command line flags for the `create` sub-command from an `ini` style
configuration file, by using the `--config` and optional `--config-path` options to specify the path
to the configuration file.  If `--config-path` is ommited, then `torrentfile` will look by default in the current
working directory for a file named `torrentfile.ini`. If the file is not discovered in the current working directory, 
it will move on to look `~/.torrentfile/torrentfile.ini` followed by `~/.config/torrentfile.ini`.  Please see the 
[documentation](https://alexpdev.github.io/torrentfile/overview/) for more details on how the configuration file should be
formatted.

### Check/Recheck Torrent

The `recheck` subcommand allows you to scan a Bittorrent file and compare it's contents, 
against a file or directory containing the contents the torrent file was created from.
The output provided by this process gives a detailed perspective if any files are missing
or have been corrupted in any way.  Supports any version of Bittorrent file.

```bash
torrentfile recheck /path/to/some.torrent /path/to/content
```

### Edit Torrent

To edit specific fields of the torrent file, there is the `edit` subcommand.  Using this
subcommand you can specify the field with one of the available field flags, for example
`--tracker` and specify the value you wish to change it to.

```bash
torrentfile edit /path/to/content --tracker https://new.tracker.url1.com  https://newtracker.url/2
```

You can use the `-h` flag for a full list of available fields that can be edited.

    __`torrentfile`__ edit -h

### Create Magnet

To create a magnet URI for a pre-existing torrent meta file, use the sub-command  
`magnet` or `m` with the path to the torrent file.

```bash
torrentfile magnet /path/to/some.torrent
```
