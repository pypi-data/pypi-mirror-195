# VisualMathematics

A python library to visualize mathematics (e.g. prime numbers)
https://github.com/lukaDornbach/VisualMathematics

Project VisualMathematics aims to show students all over the world how fascinating mathematics is. To make this possible, a python library is developed here, which should make it possible for everyone to discover the beauty of mathematics. This project has just started and I am excited to see where it goes. 
I would be happy if more passionate developers would help to drive this project forward.


At this early developing state you can use this package by installing it with the following command:
pip install VisualMathematics

Here is a list of functions that are currently available:

Fibonacci(), to visualize the Fibonacci pattern

Venn(), to show the randomness of pi

infiniteTriangle(), to visualize that infinite triangle can fit in only one trinagle

Ulam(), to visualize prime numbers

Theodorus(), the spiral of Theodorus
