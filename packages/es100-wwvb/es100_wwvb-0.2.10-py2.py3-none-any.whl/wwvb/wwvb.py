WWVB Location ...

    WWVB
    5701 CO-1,
    Fort Collins, CO 80524
    https://goo.gl/maps/KgRn1jDmJ3zSUfxx7

    40.678062N, 105.046688W

    https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-distribution/radio-station-wwvb

    North antenna coordinates: 40째 40' 51.3" N, 105째 03' 00.0" W == 40.680917 N, 105.050000 W
    South antenna coordinates: 40째 40' 28.3" N, 105째 02' 39.5" W == 40.674528 N, 105.044306 W

Speed of radio waves ...

    https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1701081

    299,775 km/s in a vacuum
    299,250 km/s for 100Khz at ground level
    299,690 km/s for cm waves
    299,750 km/s for aircraft at 30,000 feet (9,800 meters)

    I choose 299,250 km/s
