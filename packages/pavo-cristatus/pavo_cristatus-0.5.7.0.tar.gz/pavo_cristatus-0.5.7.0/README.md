# pavo_cristatus
Pavo cristatus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_peafowl) is the species name of the common peacock.  Type hints is like the common peacock: shiny, has the appearance of sophistication, attracts many, but ultimately offers little in practical terms.  Thus, type hints often becomes more of a liability than an asset.  This project is borne out of the acknowledgement that many people find type hints attractive regardless of what dissenters think and with the hope that said people also see some of the more glaring drawbacks of using type hints.  This project provides a means to keep type hints out of production code; by keeping type hints annotations separate from the code itself.
