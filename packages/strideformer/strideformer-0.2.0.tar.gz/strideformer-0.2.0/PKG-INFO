A package that includes an implementation of a two-transformer
setup to classify long documents. The first stage is a 
sentence-transformer which embeds chunks of the text. The second 
stage is a generic transformer used to classify the documents
based on a sequence of embeddings from the first model. 
Training scripts included.
