  A small tool for automating collecting data from ChatGPT over long periods of time.
</p>

## What does it do?
ChatGPT currently limits the number of questions that users may ask per hour. The goal of this project is to allow users to just leave their computers on for extended periods of time to collect large amounts of responses from ChatGPT. There might not be a lot of practical use for this. Its main use is in research or data analysis.

## Install as a Python Library
```
pip install sleepyask
```

## Sample code
There are multiple ways to configure authentication with ChatGPT:  
**Email + Password**  
```python
config = {
  "email": "Your ChatGPT email",
  "password": "Your ChatGPT password"
}
```  

**Access Token**  
Access token can be found here: https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session
```python
config = {
  "access_token": "Your access token"
}
```

### Single account
Example usage:
```python
from sleepyask.chat import sleepy_ask

# Your ChatGPT login information
config = {
  "email": "Your ChatGPT email",
  "password": "Your ChatGPT password"
}

# List of questions you would like to ask ChatGPT
question_list = [
  'What is 1 + 1?',
  'What is 1 + 2?',
  'What is 1 + 3?'
]

# The filename in which you would like your responses to be stored.
output_file_path = 'draw.json'  

# Run sleepy_ask
sleepy_ask(config=config,
           questions=question_list,
           output_file_path=output_file_path,
           verbose=True)
```
### Multiple accounts
You can use multiple accounts to collect responses at a significantly quicker rate.  
Example usage:
```python
from sleepyask.chat import sleepy_ask

# Your ChatGPT login information
config_1 = {
  "email": "Your ChatGPT email",
  "password": "Your ChatGPT password"
}

config_2 = {
  "email": "Your ChatGPT email",
  "password": "Your ChatGPT password"
}

configs = [config_1, config_2]

# List of questions you would like to ask ChatGPT
question_list = [
  'What is 1 + 1?',
  'What is 1 + 2?',
  'What is 1 + 3?'
]

# The filename in which you would like your responses to be stored.
output_file_path = 'draw.json'  

# Run sleepy_ask
sleepy_ask_multi(configs=configs,
           questions=question_list,
           output_file_path=output_file_path,
           verbose=True)
```
