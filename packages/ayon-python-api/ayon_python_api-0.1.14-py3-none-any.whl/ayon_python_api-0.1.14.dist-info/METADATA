# AYON server API
Python client for connection server. Client must be (at least for some time) Python 2 compatible because will be used in DCC that are "older".

AYON Python api should support connection to server with raw REST functions and prepared functionality for work with entities. Must not contain only functionality that can be used with core server functionality.

Module support singleton connection which is using `AYON_SERVER_URL` and `AYON_TOKEN` environment variables as source for connection. The singleton connection is using `ServerAPI` object. There can be created multiple connection to different server at one time, for that purpose use `ServerAPIBase` object. 

## TODOs
- More clear what is difference in `ServerAPIBase` and `ServerAPI` (`server.py` and `server_api.py`) and better names
    - `ServerAPI` was added primarily for desktop app which handle login and logout in a different way so the class should be maybe removed and `ServerAPIBase` should be renamed to `ServerAPI`
    - find more suitable names of classes
    - find more suitable name of objects (right now is used `connection` or `con`)
- Add folder and task changes to operations
  - Entity hub should use operations to update folders and tasks
