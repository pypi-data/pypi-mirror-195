# Installation and Usage

1. Install the package with pip install.

```sh
pip install terminalgpt -U
```

2. (Optional) Inject the token to the executable script on your local machine so you don't have to export it every time you open a new terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adamyodinsky/TerminalGPT.git
cd TerminalGPT
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY>
./inject_token.sh
```

Note: When not using the inject_token.sh script, you will need to export the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your open AI token every time you open a new terminal.

## Usage

```sh
terminalgpt
```
