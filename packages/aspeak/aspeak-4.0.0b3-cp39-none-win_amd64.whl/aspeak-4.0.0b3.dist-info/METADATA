A simple text-to-speech client which enables you to try out Azure's speech synthesis API directly in your terminal. :laughing:

You can try the Azure TTS API online: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech

# Note

This is the `aspeak` rewritten in rust. The old python version is available at the `python` branch.

**Please note that the rust rewritten version is experimental and has bugs!**
