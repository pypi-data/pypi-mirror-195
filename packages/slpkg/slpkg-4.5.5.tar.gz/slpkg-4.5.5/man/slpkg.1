.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Slpkg is a software package manager that installs, updates, and removes packages on Slackware based systems.
It automatically computes dependencies and figures out what things should occur to install packages.
Slpkg makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update.
.P
Slpkg works in accordance with the standards of the organization SlackBuilds.org to build packages.
Also uses the Slackware Linux instructions for installation, upgrading or removing packages.
