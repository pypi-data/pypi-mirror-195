# visualscript
Work in progress.

This module's goal is to allow you to create simple python programs 
as graphs of nodes representing functions, variables and statements.

As a main reference it uses visual language of Unreal Engine's 
blueprints graphs, which serve as an amazing tool for quick prototyping, 
especially for people less experienced in programming.

Special thanks to https://www.youtube.com/@DeadMeat37 for tutorial series
on how to make node editor.

If you like this idea, and you feel like you could help with improving 
this module, feel free to contact me.
