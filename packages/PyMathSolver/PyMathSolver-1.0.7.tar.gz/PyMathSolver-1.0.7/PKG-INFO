# PyMathSolver

## Introduction

PyMathSolver is a Python module to solve math problems and work on calculations.

## Installing and Importing

Run the following command `pip install PyMathSolver` to install the module.

To import the module, use `import PyMathSolver`.

When you run `PyMathSolver.about()`, you can get a little more information on this module.

## Utilities

Till now, this module can only work on Quadratic Equations. Many more utilities are on their way!

### 1) Quadratic Equations

To import this, use the following code `from PyMathSolver import Quadratic`. To know more about Quadratic Equation and their usage, use `Quadratic.about()`.

To find the roots of a quadratic equations, you can use the `Quadratic.findRoots(a, b, c)` function where a, b, and c are the co-efficients/values that you need to enter. It will return the 2 roots as a tuple.
