To import the module, use `import PyMathSolver`.

When you run `PyMathSolver.about()`, you can get a little more information on this module and how you can use it.

## Utilities

This module can only work on:

1) Quadratic Equations - Use `from PyMathSolver import Quadratic` and then use `Quadratic.about()` to learn how to use it.
2) Volumes - Use `from PyMathSolver import Volume` and then use `Volume.about()` to learn how to use it.
3) Numbers - Use `from PyMathSolver import Numbers` and then use `Numbers.about()` to learn how to use it.
4) Area - Use `from PyMathSolver import Area` and then use `Area.about()` to learn how to use it.
5) Surface Area - Use `from PyMathSolver import SurfaceArea` and then use `SurfaceArea.about()` to learn how to use it.
6) Lateral Surface Area - Use `from PyMathSolver import LateralSurfaceArea` and then use `LateralSurfaceArea.about()` to learn how to use it.
7) Coordinate Geometry - Use `from PyMathSolver import CoordinateGeometry` and then use `CoordinateGeometry.about()` to learn how to use it.

Many more utilities are on their way!
