def shannon_entropy(time, mag, magerr):
    """
    Shannon entropy (Shannon et al. 1949) is used as a metric to quantify the amount of
    information carried by a signal. The procedure employed here follows that outlined by
    (D. Mislis et al. 2015). The probability of each point is given by a Cumulative Distribution
    Function (CDF). Following the same procedure as (D. Mislis et al. 2015), this function employs
    both the normal and inversed gaussian CDF, with the total shannon entropy given by a combination of
    the two. See: (SIDRA: a blind algorithm for signal detection in photometric surveys, D. Mislis et al., 2015)
