['# Overview\n', 'The `linref` library builds on tabular and geospatial libraries `pandas` and `geopandas` to implement powerful features for linearly referenced data through `EventsCollection` and other object classes. Linear referencing operations powered by the `numpy`, `shapely`, and `rangel` open-source libraries allow for optimized implementations of common and advanced linearly referenced data management, manipulation, and analysis operations.\n', '\n', 'Some of the main features of this library include:\n', '- Event dissolves using `EventsCollection.dissolve()`\n', '- Merging and overlaying multiple tables of events with the `EventsCollection.merge()` method and the `EventsMerge` class API and its many linearly-weighted overlay aggregators\n', '- Linear aggregations of data such as sliding window analysis with the powerful `EventsMerge.distribute()` method\n', '- Resegmentation of linear data with `EventsCollection.to_windows()` and related methods\n', '- Creating unions of multiple `EventsCollection` instances with the `EventsUnion` object class.\n', '\n', '# Code Snippets\n', 'Create an events collection for a sample roadway events dataframe with unique  \n', "route identifier represented by the 'Route' column and data for multiple years, \n", "represented by the 'Year' column.

Performance times are significantly improved, especially for large datasets with many events groups.\n', '- Improve distribute method performance which was added in recent versions.\n', "- Drop duplicates in .project() method when using sjoin_nearest with newer versions of geopandas. Improved validation in .project() method, address edge case where projecting geometry column has a non-standard label (e.g., not 'geometry').\n", '- Added .sort() method to events collection.

API and aggregation methods are largely the same.\n', '- Modified closed parameter use in merge relationships in accordance with rangel v0.0.6, which now performs intersections which honor the closed parameter on the left collection as well as the right collection. This provides more accurate results for events which fall on the edges of intersecting events when using left_mod or right_mod closed parameters.\n', '- Updates to account for rangel 0.0.6 version which is now a minimum version requirement.
