``pdfbook`` rearranges pages from a PDF document into "signatures"
for printing books or booklets, creating a new PDF file.

This is much like ``psbook`` does for Postscript files, but working
with PDF. Indeed ``pdfbook`` was inspired by ``psbook``.

For more information please refer to the manpage or visit
the `project homepage <http://pdfbook.readthedocs.io/>`_.
