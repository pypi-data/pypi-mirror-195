# Streamsync

Like Streamlit, but fast. A proof-of-concept framework built using TypeScript/Vue.js + Python/FastAPI + WebSockets.

By avoiding a rerun of the whole script, Streamsync can react more than 70 times faster. This is all achieved while maintaining a similar syntax. This repository is a companion to the following Medium article (no paywall), which explains how Streamsync was built, the tests conducted and the implications: https://medium.com/@ramiromedina/like-streamlit-but-fast-enabling-low-latency-data-apps-948b95b098a2.

Please note that for the time being Streamsync isn't a viable, fully-fledged alternative to Streamlit, but rather a demonstration that a much faster alternative is possible. If there's some interest, I'll develop this into a viable alternative.
