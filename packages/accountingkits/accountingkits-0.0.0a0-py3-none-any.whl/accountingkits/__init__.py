"""
package principle:
    1. Input and output should end with input/return type
       Like list/arr/df/bool_arr/dict/int/float/str...
    2. constant vars should be UPPER_CASE, others be snake_case
    3. IMPORTANT: ALL CHANGEABLE TYPE(df,array,list) should 
        DEEP COPY before CHANGED IN MEMORY!
