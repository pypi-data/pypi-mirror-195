This repository contains different tools written in `python3` to examine properties of firmware binaries provided by Frontier Smart (former Frontier Silicon - FS) and to interact with the inbuild API. The decompiler used here was forked initially from the [dead0007](https://github.com/molnarg/dead0007/blob/master/README.md) repository.

Allthough there are some repositories that focus on that specific API, the implementation provided here contains all available `Nodes` that were invented/developed by Frontier Smart. The nodes were converted from `java` source code (The [Tool](apk/node_converter.py) is also in this repository).

In order to use the tools provided by this repository, almost all available firmware binaries are located in the folder [`bin/`](bin/). Most of them were forked from [here](https://github.com/cweiske/frontier-silicon-firmwares).

## Documents

A detailed review of the firmware binaries that are used to update Frontier Smart devicesis provided in the following document: [`firmware-2.0`](docs/firmware-2.0.md). The FSAPI (NetRemoteApi) by Frontier-Smart is described here: [frontier-smart-api documentation](https://frontier-smart-api.readthedocs.io/). For decompiling the ECMAScript

**Important Notice**: The `fisu` module is deprecated and should not be used. All functionalities were ported to the `isu` sub-module of `fsapi`. Usage information and examples are given in the [fsapi.isu](https://frontier-smart-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/isu/) documentation.

**Notice (UNIX only)**: Since version `0.2.0` there is another sub-module placed in the `fsapi` directory - named `ecmascript`. Its functionalities are described in the [fsapi.ecmascript](https://frontier-smart-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/ecmascript/) part of the documentation.

## Overview
---

As stated above, this repository provides a uitlity to interact with the FSAPI (Frontier Smart API) and a research on how the firmware binaries are structured. Devices and Apps used within the research:

> `Medion MD87805`, Apps: `Lifestream II` and `UNDOK`

The source code for these apps were retrieved directly from a mobile device with the `adb`-tool:

```bash
# list all installed packages and search for the app
$ adb pm list packages
# get the path to the specified app
$ adb pm path ${app.package.com}
# pull the source code to the local machine
$ adb pull $PATH_TO_APK_FILE $LOCAL_PATH
```

In order to view the decompiled `java`-code, the `jadx`
-decompiler and `jadx-gui` were used. This tool also provides an export function to save the decompiled `java` sources locally.

The source code contains a package called `src/com/frontier_silicon/NetRemoteLib/Node/` where all available nodes are stored/ implemented with a `java` class each. There was also a [tool](apk/node_converter.py) created to convert these classes into python classes. To use  the generated code you have to copy [this](fsapi/netremote/basenode.py) python file. **Update:** When converting the Java-classes to Python code, four nodes won't be covered by default. Since `0.2.2` there are additional pre-defined [Java-Classes](apk) that have to be copied before generating the nodes.

Lets take a look at the network traffic produced by the internet radio. In order to capture all packets, a proxy could be very useful. Because there is no possibility to setup a simple proxy on that device, the traffic was captured directly on the connected wifi access point.

---
A quick look at the produced network traffic in wireshark reveals some interesting facts:

    * The communication between the device and clients is handled 
      with HTTP
    * Specific URLs are queried when looking for a software update. 
      These are:
        > update.wifiradiofrontier.com/FindUpdate.aspx
        > update.wifiradiofrontier.com/Update.aspx

The first URL returns `404` or `403` if no update is available. Is an update available, there will be a XML-response by the first URL-query. The structure is mentioned at the class defintion of [`ISUSoftwareElement`](docs/api-2.0.md#11-class-definitions).

The firmware binaries are located at the second URL with the mandatory parameter `f=/updates/xxx`. The name of the file is structured as follows:

```bash
> ir-$MODULE-$INTERFACE-$IFACEVERSION-${MODEL}_V$VERSION.$REVISION-$BRANCH
# on the internet radio device used here this expands to
> ir-mmi-FS2026-0500-0549_V2.12.25c.EX72088-1A12
```

Note that the file name in the URL replaces the `_V` with a simple dot. To download an update file, you can use the `fsapi` module directly. The following command collects all firmware binaries specified in the given file.

```bash
$ python3 -m fsapi isu --file ./bin/updates.txt --verbose
# alternative with local device:
$ python3 -m fsapi isu --find --collect myFile $IP_ADDRESS --verbose
```

## Tools

There are two tools included in this repository together with two python modules: `isu_inspector` and `fisu`, `fsapi_tool` and `fsapi`. Installation instructions follow:

#### __Prerequisites__

Make sure you have installed the latest version of python `setuptools` and `pip`:
```bash
$ pip install setuptools
```

#### __Installation__

This respository uses setuptools to install the python packages locally. All dependnecies used by the provided libraries should be installed by default. To install the preferred package, just type the following command:

```bash
$ pip install .
``` 

This command should install the selected library to the local site-packages. Now, you are good to go - execute the module with

```bash
python3 -m $module --help
```


### ISUInspector
---

```console
$ python3 -m fsapi.isu --help

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -if IF         The input file (must have the *.isu.bin or *.ota.bin extension)
  -of OF         The output file (Format: XML).
  --verbose      Prints useful information during the specified process.
  -insp INSP     Sets the ISUInspector descriptor, which will be used to retrieve the inspector instance.

information gathering:
  --header       Parses the header of the given file and extracts information.
  --archive      Parses the directory archive.

usage: __main__.py [-h] [-d] [-o OUT] [--use-decompiler DECOMPATH] [-r] path

positional arguments:
  path                  The target file that will be used to operate on.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --decompile       Indicates that the given input file should be decompiled.
  -o OUT, --out OUT     The path were the decompiled output should be saved.

  --use-decompiler DECOMPATH
                        Specifies the path to the decompiler.
  -r, --recurse         Indicates that all files in the given directory should be
                        decompiled
