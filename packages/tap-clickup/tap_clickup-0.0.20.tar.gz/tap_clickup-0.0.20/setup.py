Until then we parse the schemas in client.py \n\nSometimes it\'s useful to debug how the refs are being resolved. To do that there\'s a script inside of ./schema-parser , README in that directory describes how to run the parser \n\nNot worry about making this super fool proof as we expect the SDK to release some kind of fix for this\n\n### Initialize your Development Environment\n\n```bash\npipx install poetry\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Create and Run Tests\n\nCreate tests within the `tap_clickup/tests` subfolder and\n  then run:\n\n```bash\npoetry run pytest\n```\n\nYou can also test the `tap-clickup` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:\n\n```bash\npoetry run tap-clickup --help\n```\n\n### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)\n\n_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.\n\nInstall Meltano (if you haven\'t already) and any needed plugins:\n\n```bash\n# Install meltano\npipx install meltano\n# Initialize meltano within this directory\ncd tap-clickup\nmeltano install\n```\n\nNow you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:\n\n```bash\n# Test invocation:\nmeltano invoke tap-clickup --version\n# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:\nmeltano elt tap-clickup target-jsonl\n```\n\n### SDK\n\nBuilt with the [Meltano SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps and Targets.\n\n',
