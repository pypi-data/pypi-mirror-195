## Installation

```sh
pip install changedetector
```

Change detector is a tool that can be used to detect changes in your code-base.
It works with a simple command

```sh
detectchange run
```

It detects changes in your working directory. And executes the scripts chosen
when the script is executed.

It can be used to detect changes in python, ruby, Cpp  and C files.

## UPCOMING FEATURES

- [x] Watch a file change to excecute an other one (WRS - Watch Run Self, WRO  - Watch and Run Other)

```sh
 Choose the mode you want to use:

 > Watch and Run Self (WRS)
   Watch and Run Other (WRO)
```

- [ ] `watchFor`, return a dict of files that changed after a set time

```python
from changedetector import detectchange
dt = detectchange
# time in milliseconds
res = dt.watchFor(time=3000)
# res = {...}
```

- [ ] `watchFor`, shell version

```sh
detectchange --watchFor 3000
detectchange -W 3000
# return a JSON type output
```
