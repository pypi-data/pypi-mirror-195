# Supadef CLI ⚡️
_Official command-line interface to the Supadef platform._

## Overview
The ```supadef``` CLI tool allows you to interact with the Supadef platform.
You can use it to manage projects, functions, and deployments. 

[//]: # (You can use it to create, deploy, list, and destroy projects.)

## Commands

```bash
supadef login
```
