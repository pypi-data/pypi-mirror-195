class FlexScope(Openable):
    """
    A scope in the storage mechanism and policy executor of dependencies.

    A scope used by the FlexGraph is created as a linked list:

    .. code-block:: text

        RequestScope -> ApplicationScope -> GraphScope.

    When an object is requested to be created, the scope will examine the policy
    on the dependency and see if it matches. If the policy is not correct for the
    current scope, it will defer creation to its parent scope. If no scope exists
    that can manage the dependency, an error will be raised.

    Each scope manages its cache of stored dependencies, to allow instances to be
    destroyed at a granular level. i.e. A higher level scope can be closed without
    closing the parent scope. An example of this would be request scoped dependencies
    such as database connection being closed per request, while connection pool
    objects are allowed to live for the full lifetime of the application.

    Each of the scope objects in the chain will share the same copy of the dependency
    tree to speed up the resolution of items, and allow validations on declared
    dependencies to only be performed once.

    If a dependency has an eager policy, and its scope policy matches the current
    scope, then the object will be instantiated as soon as the scope is opened.
