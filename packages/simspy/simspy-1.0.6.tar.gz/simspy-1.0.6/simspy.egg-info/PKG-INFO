This package is specifically designed for solving *single-machine scheduling problems*. It comprises a total of 8 functions, including 7 heuristic functions and 1 metaheuristic function.

### Heuristic Method
 - Earliest Due Date (EDD) Rule
 - Shortest Processing Time (SPT) Rule
 - Largest Penalty per Unit Length (LPUL) Rule
 - Shortest Processing Time and LPUL Rule
 - Shortest Weighted Processing Time (SWPT) Rule
 - Largest Weight (WT) and LPUL Rule
 - Critical Ratio (CR) Rule
 
### Metaheuristic Method
 - Genetic Algorithm (GA)

## Data Input
This package requires 3 essential data inputs: **Processing Time**, **Due Date**, and **Penalty**.

| Function | Description |
| -------- |------------|
| `fc_edd` | Sort the job sequences using the Earliest Due Date Rule by arranging the jobs in ascending order based on their due dates. |
| `fc_spt` | Sort the job sequences using the Shortest Processing Time Rule by arranging the jobs in ascending order based on their processing times. |
| `fc_lpul` | Sort the job sequences using the Largest Penalty per Unit Length Rule by arranging the jobs in descending order based on their U value, which is obtained by dividing the penalty by the processing time. |
| `fc_spt_lpul` | Sort the job sequences using the Shortest Processing Time and LPUL Rule by arranging the jobs in ascending order based on their processing times. In case of a tie, use the LPUL Rule. |
| `fc_swpt` | Sort the job sequences using the Shortest Weighted Processing Time Rule by arranging the jobs in ascending order based on their S value, which is obtained by dividing the processing time by the penalty. |
| `fc_wt_lpul` | Sort jobs using the Largest Weight Rule LPUL Rule by arranging the jobs in ascending order based on their penalty. In case of a tie, use the LPUL Rule. |
| `fc_cr` | Sort the job sequences using the Critical Ratio Rule by arranging the jobs in ascending order based on their CR value. |
| `fc_ga` | Sort the job sequences using the Genetic Algorithm by arranging the jobs in a way that minimizes the total penalty. |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
