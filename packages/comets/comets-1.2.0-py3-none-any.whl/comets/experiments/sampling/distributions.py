class Distribution:

    A class to create iid distributions.

    A Distribution object in CoMETS is a wrapper around a distribution defined by an external library (scipy.stats).
    The list of available distributions and their corresponding parameters are stored in the DistributionRegistry.
    It exposes a single method `get_samples` that takes as argument a single integer and returns the corresponding number of samples randomly drawn from the distribution.
    A Distribution object handle iid distributions with optional input key 'size'.

    Args:
        variable (dict): a dictionnary containing the following key/value pairs:
            * "name"/str, defining the variable name
            * "sampling"/str, defining the distribution name
            * "parameters"/dict, defining the dictionary of parameters to pass to the distribution
            * "size"/int, (optional) specifies how many iid copies of the variable to construct
