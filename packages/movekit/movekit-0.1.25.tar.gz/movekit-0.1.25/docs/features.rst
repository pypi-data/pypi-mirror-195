Extracting features
===========
One can easily calculate features such as distance, direction, average speed, average acceleration, turning and stops of the mover with the `extract_features` function.

**extract_features(data, fps=10, stop_threshold=0.5)**:
    | Calculate and return all absolute features for input animal group.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame with all records of movements.
    | param fps: size of window used to calculate average speed and average acceleration: integer to define size of window for integer-formatted time or string to define size of window for datetime-formatted time (For possible units refer to: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases.)
    | param stop_threshold: integer to specify threshold for average speed, such that we consider time step a "stop".
    | return: pandas DataFrame with additional variables consisting of all relevant features.
    | Notes to extracted features:
    | *Distance*: returns metric distance in between two time steps.
    | *Direction*: returns movement vector for each time step by checking the difference of the coordinates to the previous time step.
    | *Average speed*: Compute average speed of mover based on fps parameter. The formula used for calculating average speed is: (Total Distance traveled) / (Total time taken).
    | Size of traveling window is determined by fps parameter:
    | By choosing f.e. fps=4 at time step 5: (distance covered from time step 3 to time step 7) / 4.
    | By choosing f.e. fps=3 at time step 5: (distance covered from time step 3.5 to time step 6.5) / 3. (in this case use of interpolation if time steps 3.5 and 6.5 do not exist.)
    | *Average acceleration*: Compute average acceleration of mover based on fps parameter. The formula used for calculating average acceleration is: (Final Speed - Initial Speed) / (Total Time Taken).
    | Size of traveling window is determined by fps parameter:
    | By choosing f.e. fps=4 at time step 5: (speed at time step 7 - speed at time step 3) / 4.
    | By choosing f.e. fps=3 at time step 5: (speed at time step 6.5 - speed at time step 3.5) / 3. (in this case use of interpolation if time steps 3.5 and 6.5 do not exist.)
    | *Turning*: Computes the turning for a mover between two time steps as the cosine similarity between its direction vectors.
    | *Stops*: Defines a record as 'Stopped' where the value is 1 if 'Average_Speed' <= threshold_speed and 0 otherwise.

.. code-block:: python

   data_features = mkit.extract_features(data, fps = 10, stop_threshold = 0.5)
   # example for datetime-formatted time with window size of 5 seconds
   data_features = mkit.extract_features(data, fps = '5S', stop_threshold = 0.5)

For 2-dimensional data one can also extract the direction and turning angle for a mover between two timesteps by using `compute_direction_angle` and `compute_turning_angle`.

**compute_direction_angle(data, param_x='x', param_y='y', colname='direction_angle')**:
    | Computes the angle of rotation of an animal between two timesteps. Only possible if coordinates are 2D only.
    | param data: dataframe containing the movement records
    | param param_x: column name of the x coordinate
    | param param_y: column name of the y coordinate
    | param colname: the name to appear in the new DataFrame for the direction angle computed.
    | return: dataframe containing computed 'direction_angle' as angle from 0-360 degrees (x-axis to the right is 0 degrees)

**compute_turning_angle(data, colname='turning_angle', direction_angle_name='direction_angle')**:
    | Computes the turning angle for a mover between two timesteps as the difference of its direction angle. Only possible for 2D data.
    | param data: dataframe containing the movement records.
    | param colname: the name of the new column to be added.
    | param direction_angle_name: the name of the column containg the direction angle for each movement record.
    | return: dataframe containing an additional column with the difference in degrees between current and previous time step for each record.
    | Note that difference can not be higher than +-180 degrees.

.. code-block:: python

   data_direction_angle = mkit.direction_angle(data)
   data_turning_angle = mkit.turning_angle(data)

*****
Computing distances between movers and between time steps
*****
Distances between different movers can easily be computed. For example the euclidean distance is computed with the function `euclidean_dist`.

**euclidean_dist(data)**:
    | Compute the euclidean distance between movers for one individual grouped time step using the Scipy 'pdist' and 'squareform' methods.
    | param data: Preprocessed pandas DataFrame with positional record data containing no duplicates.
    | return: pandas DataFrame, including computed euclidean distances.

.. code-block:: python

   distances = mkit.euclidean_dist(data)

Also one can analyze the distance between the different positions of each mover for a particular time window.

**distance_by_time(data, frm, to)**:
    | Computes the distance between positions for a particular time window for all movers.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame with all records of movements.
    | param frm: int defining the start of the time window. Note that if time is stored as a date (if input data has time not stored as numeric type it is automatically converted to datetime) parameter has to be set using an datetime format: mkit.distance_by_time(data, "2008-01-01", "2010-10-01")
    | param to: Int, defining end point up to where to extract records.
    | param to: int defining the end of the time window (inclusive)
    | return: pandas DataFrame with animal_id and distance

.. code-block:: python

   distances = mkit.distance_by_time(data, frm, to)

Additionally one can obtain a matrix of the trajectory similarities, based on the Hausdorff distance of trajectories of the animals with the function `hausdorff_distance`.

**hausdorff_distance(data, mover1=None, mover2=None)**:
    | Calculate the Hausdorff-Distance between trajectories of different movers.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame containing movement records.
    | param mover1: animal_id of the first mover if Hausdorff distance is just to be calculated between two movers.
    | param mover2: animal_id of the second mover if Hausdorff distance is just to be calculated between two movers
    | return: Hausdorff distance between two specified movers. If no movers are specified, Hausdorff distance between all movers in the data to each other as a Pandas DataFrame.

.. code-block:: python

   mkit.hausdorff_distance(data)

*****
Computing centroids and medoids for each time stamp
*****
With `centroid_medoid_computation` the centroids, the medoids and the distances of each mover to the centriod can be calculated for each time stamp.

**centroid_medoid_computation(data, only_centroid=False, object_output=False)**:
    | Calculates the data point (animal_id) closest to center/centroid/medoid for a time step
    | param data: Pandas DataFrame containing movement records
    | param only_centroid: Boolean in case we just want to compute the centroids. Default: False.
    | param object_output: Boolean whether to create a point object for the calculated centroids. Default: False.
    | return: Pandas DataFrame containing computed medoids & centroids

.. code-block:: python

   centroid_medoid_computation(data, only_centroid=False, object_output=False)

*****
Exploring the geospatial features and plotting the data
*****
Furthermore plots can easily be created, such as the movement from all movers in a specified time period or the movements from individual movers.

**plot_movement(data, frm, to)**:
    | Plot 'x' and 'y' attributes for given Pandas DataFrame in specified time frame.
    | param data: Pandas DataFrame (should be sorted by 'time' attribute).
    | param frm: Starting from time step. Note that if time is stored as a date (if input data has time not stored as numeric type it is automatically converted to datetime) parameter has to be set using an datetime format: mkit.plot_movement(data, "2008-01-01", "2010-10-01")
    | param to: Ending to time step.
    | return: None.

**plot_animal(inp_data, animal_id)**:
    | Plot individual animal's 'x' and 'y' coordinates.
    | param inp_data: DataFrame containing 'x' & 'y' attributes.
    | param animal_id: ID of animal to be plotted.
    | return: None.

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.plot_movement(data, frm, to)
    mkit.plot_animal(inp_data, animal_id)

Also animations of the movements from the different movers can be displayed and saved as gif.

**animate_movement(data, viewsize)**:
    | Animated version of plot_movement function.
    | Animates 'x' and 'y' attributes for given Pandas DataFrame in specified time frame.
    | param data: Pandas DataFrame (should be sorted by 'time' attribute).
    | param viewsize: Int. Define how many time steps/frames should be visible in the animation.

**save_animation_plot(animation_object, filename)**:
    | Save animation as gif file in working directory.
    | param animation_object: created animation object
    | param filename: name of the file which is created

.. code-block:: python

    anim = mkit.animate_movement(data, 100)
    mkit.save_animation_plot(anim, 'filename')

One can also plot either the average acceleration or the average speed for each individual mover/animal over time.

**plot_pace(avg_speed_data, feature="speed")**:
    | Plot average speed or average acceleration extracted feature for each animal.
    | param avg_speed_data: pandas Dataframe including average speed feature.
    | param feature: either 'speed' or 'acceleration'
    | return: None.

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.plot_pace(data_features, "speed")

One can additionally check the geospatial distribution of the different movers. The function `explore_features_geospatial` shows the exploration of environment space by each animal. It gives singular descriptions of polygon area covered by each animal and combined.

**explore_features_geospatial(preprocessed_data)**:
    | Show exploration of environment space by each animal using 'shapely' package.
    | Gives singular descriptions of polygon area covered by each animal and combined. Additionally a plot of the respective areas is provided.
    | param preprocessed_data: pandas DataFrame, containing preprocessed movement records.
    | return: None.

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.explore_features_geospatial(data)

To get the percentage environment space explored by singular animal one can use `explore_features`.

**explore_features(data)**:
    | Show percentage of environment space explored by singular animal.
    | Using minimum and maximum of coordinates, given by 'x' and 'y' (and 'z') features in input DataFrame.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame, containing preprocessed movement records.
    | return: None.

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.explore_features(data)

To examine the number of time steps for each mover id one can call `plot_animal_timesteps`.

**plot_animal_timesteps(data)**:
    | Plot the number of time steps for each 'animal_id'
    | param data_animal_id_groups: DataFrame containing movement records.
    | return: None

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.plot_animal_timesteps(data)

Geodata can be plotted on an interactive map by calling `plot_geodata`, afterwards it can be saved using `save_geodata_map`.

**plot_geodata(data, latitude_colname = "location-lat", longitude_colname = "location-long", animal_list=[], movement_lines=False)**:
    | Function to plot geo data on an interactive map using Open Street Maps.
    | param data: DataFrame containing the movement records

    mkit.save_geodata(map, 'new_map')

To find hot spots in the dataset the Getis-Ord\ :sup:`*`\  statistic is calculated for different space-time intervals. For
a detailed description of the statistic please refer to https://sigspatial2016.sigspatial.org/giscup2016/problem. Using this Getis-Ord\ :sup:`*`\  statistic
one can draw heatmaps for the intervals in a given time range.

**getis_ord(data, x_grids_per_t=3, y_grids_per_t=3, time_grids=3)**:
    | Calculate the Getis-Ord G* statistic for each x-y-time interval of the data. Interval size is specified by input.
    | param data: pandas Data frame containing the movement data in the columns x, y and time.
    | param x_grids_per_t: int defining how many x intervals there are for each time step. The x axis is subdivided uniformly, i.e. if the maximum value of x in the data is 100 and the minimum value is 10, by setting x_grids_per_t = 3 for each time step there are 3 intervals ([10,40),[40,70),[70,100])
    | param y_grids_per_t: int defining how many y intervals there are for each time step. The y axis is subdivided uniformly, i.e. if the maximum value of y in the data is 50 and the minimum value is 10, by setting y_grids_per_t = 4 for each time step there are 4 intervals ([10,20),[20,30),[30,40),[50,50]).
    | param time_grids: int defining how many time intervals there are. The time axis is subdivided uniformly, i.e. if the maximum value of time in the data is 500 and the minimum value is 0, by setting time_grids = 5 there are 5 time intervals ([0,100),[100,200),[200,300),[300,400),[400,500])
    | Note that if one defines f.e. x_grids_per_t = 3, y_grids_per_t = 3 and time_grids = 5 the space time cube used for calculating G* contains 3*3*5=45 intervals.
    | return: Pandas data frame containing the Getis-Ord statistic for each examined interval (intervals are defined by six columns defining the respective start and end values of the intervals' x-coordinate, y-coordinate and time.

**plot_heatmap(data, time0_start, time0_end, round_digits=1, font_size=10, linewidth=0.5)**:
    | Plot a heatmap for the mover for user defined time interval.
    | param data: data frame returned by function getis_ord(): Data frame containing xy- interval coordinates and respective Getis-Ord statistic.
    | param time0_start: beginning time of the earliest interval included in the heatmap.
    | param time0_end: beginning time of the latest interval included in the heatmap.
    | param round_digits: for clear axis description the xy-values of the displayed intervals are rounded to have user defined number of digits.
    | param font_size: for clear axis description font size of the axis ticks can be defined.
    | param linewidth: width of the line dividing each cell in heatmap.

.. code-block:: python

    GO = mkit.getis_ord(data, x_grids_per_t=10, y_grids_per_t=10, time_grids=20)
    mkit.plot_heatmap(GO, 2, 6)


*****
Splitting the trajectory of each animal in different subsets
*****
Movekit has a function to split the trajectories for each animal into moving and stopping phases according to a given stop threshold.
Additionally the durations of these individual phases can be examined. Both functions return a dictionary with animal ID as key.

**split_movement_trajectory(data, stop_threshold=0.5, csv=False)**:
    | Split trajectories of movers in stopping and moving phases.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame containing preprocessed movement records.
    | param stop_threshold: integer to specify threshold for average speed, such that we consider time step a "stop".
    | param csv: Boolean, defining if each phase shall be exported locally as singular csv.
    | return: dictionary with animal_id as key and list of individual dataFrames for each movement phase as values.

**movement_stopping_durations(data, stop_threshold=0.5)**:
    | Split trajectories of movers in stopping and moving phases and return the duration of each phase.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame containing preprocessed movement records.
    | param stop_threshold: integer to specify threshold for average speed, such that we consider time step a "stop".
    | return: dictionary with animal_id as key and DataFrame with the different phases and their durations as value.

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.split_movement_trajectory(data, stop_threshold = 0.5)
    mkit.movement_stopping_durations(data_features, stop_threshold = 0.5)

Additionally one can split the data in different subsets each having certain values for a specified feature.

**segment_data(data, feature, threshold, csv=False, fps=10, stop_threshold=0.5)**:
    | Segment data in subsets by feature values using a given threshold value. For instance, by using the average speed as feature split the dataset in segments above and below a given threshold.
    | param data: dataframe containing the feature which is used to split the dataset. Note that if feature is 'distance', 'average_speed', 'average_acceleration', 'direction', 'stopped' or 'turning', feature can also be extracted within the function. In that case one should define the input parameters to use when extract_features() is called.
    | param feature: column name of the feature used to split data in subsets.
    | param threshold: threshold used to split data according to feature value.
    | param csv: Boolean, defining if each subset shall be exported locally as singular csv.
    | param fps: used if features are not extracted before but within the function by calling extract_features(): size of window used to calculate average speed and average acceleration: integer to define size of window for integer-formatted time or string to define size of window for datetime-formatted time (For possible units refer to:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases.)
    | param stop_threshold: used if features are not extracted before but within the function by calling extract_features(): integer to specify threshold for average speed, such that we consider timestamp a "stop".
    | return: dictionary with id of different movers as key and a list of all the subsets for this mover as values. Subsets are thereby stored as dataframe.

*****
Time series analysis
*****
Movekit also allows to extract many time series features by defining the required feature as parameter of the `ts_feature`. For a full list of all the features that can be extracted refer to https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text/list_of_features.html.

**ts_feature(data, feature)**:
    | Perform time series analysis by extracting specified time series features from record data.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame, containing preprocessed movement records and features.
    | param feature: time series feature which is extracted from the movement records.
    | return: pandas DataFrame, containing defined extracted time series features for each id for each feature.

**ts_all_features(data)**:
    | Perform time series analysis on record data.
    | param data: pandas DataFrame, containing preprocessed movement records and features.
    | return: pandas DataFrame, containing extracted time series features for each id for each feature.

.. code-block:: python

    mkit.ts_feature(data, feature)
    mkit.ts_all_feature(data)
