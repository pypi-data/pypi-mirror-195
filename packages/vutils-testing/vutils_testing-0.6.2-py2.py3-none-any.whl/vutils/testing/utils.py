    This function becomes handy when creating types used as test data. For

    This helps to keep test data in the proper scope and to reduce the size of
    the code base.

class LazyInstance:
    r"""
    Support lazy initialization.

    Object is constructed/initialized at time when its member function is
    called. Example::

        foo_factory = LazyInstance(Foo, initialize_once=False)
        foo = foo_factory.create(1, bar=2)
        test(foo.quux)

    when ``test`` calls ``foo.quux``, ``Foo(1, bar=2)`` is invoked first
    to make the instance of ``Foo`` and to cache the instance inside
    ``foo_factory``. Then, from this instance, ``quux`` is invoked. Since
    ``foo_factory`` was created with *initialize_once* property set to `False`,
    ``foo`` is initialized every time when ``foo.quux`` is invoked.

    The story behind `LazyInstance`: consider the following snippet of code::

        class Foo:
            def __init__(self):
                self.stream = sys.stderr

            def greet(self):
                self.stream.write("Hello!\n")


        def test(func, mystream):
            # Replace sys.stderr for mystream:
            with SysStderrPatcher(mystream).patch():
                func()

    in this scenario::

        mystream = io.StringIO()
        foo = Foo()
        test(foo.greet, mystream)

    ``Hello!\n`` will be send to `sys.stderr` since the patching has been done
    too late. This is where `LazyInstance` comes to help us::

        mystream = io.StringIO()
        foo_factory = LazyInstance(Foo)
        foo = foo_factory.create()
        test(foo.greet, mystream)

    now,  ``Hello!\n`` is written to ``mystream`` as expected.
