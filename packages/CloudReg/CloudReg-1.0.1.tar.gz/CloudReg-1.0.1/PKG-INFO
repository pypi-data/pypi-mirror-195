# Overview
Quantifying terascale multi-modal human and animal imaging data requires scalable analysis tools. We developed CloudReg, an automated, terascale, cloud-based image analysis pipeline for preprocessing and cross-modal, non-linear registration between volumetric datasets with artifacts. CloudReg was developed using cleared mouse and rat brain light-sheet microscopy images, but is also accurate in registering the following datasets to their respective atlases: *in vivo* human and *ex vivo* macaque brain magnetic resonance imaging, *ex vivo* murine brain micro-computed tomography. Our extensive documentation (below) can enable deployment of this tool for many other datasets/research questions.

# Documentation
The official documentation with usage is at https://cloudreg.neurodata.io

Please visit the [Run section](https://cloudreg.neurodata.io/run.html) in the official website for more in depth usage.

# System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
`CloudReg` requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations since the majority of work is run in cloud services.

## Software requirements
### OS Requirements
`CloudReg` is tested on the following OSes and requires Python 3:
- Linux x64
- macOS x64

# Installation Guide
Please see [Setup](https://cloudreg.neurodata.io/setup.html) on the official website for detailed set up information.
